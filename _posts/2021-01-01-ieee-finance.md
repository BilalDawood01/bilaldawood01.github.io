As Treasurer for the IEEE UofC Student Branch, I was responsible for managing and maintaining the branchâ€™s financial accounts. This role involved preparing and submitting annual budget reports, developing financial strategies to ensure sufficient funding for events, and advising on cost allocation. I also presented financial data to the executive council, demonstrating strong analytical and communication skills. My work ensured the branch's financial health and supported its various activities, contributing to the growth and success of the organization.
