**Team Zeus** is a student-led engineering team focused on designing and building electric motorbikes for competitions and research. As a member of this innovative team, I contributed to several key areas:

- **Document Development:** Created comprehensive and easily understandable documents for modifications on an electric motorcycle, ensuring clear communication and detailed instructions.

- **Electrical Systems Integration:** Collaborated with technical teams to integrate electrical systems into the vehicle, focusing on achieving seamless functionality and ensuring compatibility.

- **Drafting and Data Management:** Executed multiple drafting tasks and maintained synchronous data-keeping across all electrical sub-teams, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

- **BMS and ECU Design and Testing:** Assisted in the design and testing of the Battery Management System (BMS) and Electrical Control Unit (ECU), including component selection and system integration.

- **Workshop Safety and Bike Operation:** Gained practical knowledge of bike operation principles and workshop safety practices, enhancing both technical skills and operational awareness.



My work with Team Zeus provided valuable hands-on experience in engineering and teamwork, which has been a great asset in my development as an engineer.
